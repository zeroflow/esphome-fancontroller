## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Web Installer (Recommended)

Flash pre-built firmware directly from your browser at **[fancontroller.arthofer.dev](https://fancontroller.arthofer.dev/)**

**Note for ESP32-S2 boards (Rev 2.0, 3.x):** Web-based flashing may have connectivity issues. If the browser flash fails, use Method 2 (esptool) instead.

### Method 2: esptool (Alternative for ESP32-S2)

Reliable flashing method, especially for ESP32-S2 boards:

1. Install [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool): `pip install esptool`
2. Download prebuilt binary from [fancontroller.arthofer.dev/firmware](https://fancontroller.arthofer.dev/firmware/)
3. Connect board via USB-C, hold BOOT button, press RESET
4. Flash: `esptool.py --chip esp32s2 write_flash 0x0 firmware.bin`
5. Press RESET to boot

### Method 3: OTA Updates (After Initial Setup)

Once connected to WiFi, update wirelessly via ESPHome dashboard or web interface at `http://[board-ip]`

### Method 4: ESPHome Hardware Packages (Custom Configurations)

For users who want to customize their configuration while keeping hardware setup simple. The hardware packages automatically configure all board-specific features for your revision.

This works by adding the following lines to your esphome config:

```yaml
# Import the hardware package for your board revision
packages:
  fancontroller: github://zeroflow/esphome-fancontroller/hardware-rev-3.3.yaml@main
```

#### Example Configuration

Here's a complete example showing how to create a custom configuration using the hardware package:

```yaml
# Import the hardware package for your board revision
packages:
  fancontroller: github://zeroflow/esphome-fancontroller/hardware-rev-3.3.yaml@main

esphome:
  name: my-fancontroller
  friendly_name: My Fan Controller

esp32:
  board: esp32-s2-saola-1  # Use esp32dev for Rev 1.0

ota:
  - platform: esphome

# Configure your WiFi
wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

  # Enable fallback hotspot
  ap: {}

captive_portal:
```

#### Available hardware packages:

- **Rev 3.1, 3.2, 3.3:** `hardware-rev-3.3.yaml` (ESP32-S2, esp32-s2-saola-1 board)

#### What's Included in Hardware Packages

The hardware package automatically configures all board features:
- 4× PWM fan outputs with speed control and RPM monitoring
- HDC1080 temperature & humidity sensor
- User buttons (USR1, USR2, USR3) for custom functions
- Status LEDs (RGB on Rev 3.x)
- NeoPixel output port (Rev 3.x)
- WiFi signal strength sensor
- All expansion ports and GPIO

No manual pin configuration needed - just import the package and customize your automations!

## Fan Control Modules

Beyond the basic hardware configuration, this project includes optional control modules that implement different fan control strategies. These modules can be imported into your configuration to add temperature-based fan control or status displays.

### Available Modules

#### 1. RPM Status LEDs (`modules/rpm_status_leds.yaml`)

Visual feedback module that updates each fan's RGB LED based on its RPM reading. LEDs transition from red (stopped) through orange to green (full speed).

**Configuration Variables:**
- `full_rpm`: Maximum RPM for color scaling (default: 2500). At 0 RPM = red, at full_rpm = green

**Example:**
```yaml
packages:
  rpm_status_leds:
    url: https://github.com/zeroflow/esphome-fancontroller
    files: 
      - path: modules/rpm_status_leds.yaml
        vars:
          full_rpm: 2500 # RPM value considered as 100% speed
```

#### 2. Linear Temperature Control (`modules/temperature_linear.yaml`)

Simple linear fan control based on temperature. Creates a temperature curve with three zones:
- Below t_off: Fans off (0%)
- Between t_off and t1: Constant speed at fanpercent1
- Between t1 and t2: Linear ramp from fanpercent1 to fanpercent2
- Above t2: Constant speed at fanpercent2

**Configuration Variables:**
- `friendly_name`: Device name prefix (default: "fancontroller")
- `t_off`: Temperature below which fans turn off (default: 25.0°C)
- `t1`: Lower temperature setpoint (default: 30.0°C)
- `t2`: Upper temperature setpoint (default: 50.0°C)
- `fanpercent1`: Fan speed % at t1 (default: 30.0%)
- `fanpercent2`: Fan speed % at t2 and above (default: 100.0%)

**Features:**
- Individual auto-control switches for each of 4 fans
- Output value sensor showing current calculated fan speed

**Example:**
```yaml
packages:
  temperature_linear:
    url: https://github.com/zeroflow/esphome-fancontroller
    files: 
      - path: modules/temperature_linear.yaml
        vars:
          friendly_name: "Server Rack"
          t_off: "25.0"        # Fans off below 25°C
          t1: "30.0"           # Start ramping at 30°C
          t2: "50.0"           # Full speed at 50°C
          fanpercent1: "30.0"  # Minimum speed: 30%
          fanpercent2: "100.0" # Maximum speed: 100%
```

#### 3. PID Temperature Control (`modules/temperature_pid.yaml`)

Advanced PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control for precise temperature regulation. Automatically adjusts fan speeds to maintain a target temperature with minimal overshoot.

Shoutout to [patrickcollins12/esphome-fan-controller](https://github.com/patrickcollins12/esphome-fan-controller) for the example code.

**Configuration Variables:**
- `friendly_name`: Device name prefix (default: "fancontroller")
- `kp`: Proportional gain coefficient (default: 0.39509)
- `ki`: Integral gain coefficient (default: 0.00470)
- `kd`: Derivative gain coefficient (default: 20.74267)
- `max_integral`: Maximum integral term value (default: 0.0)
- `output_averaging_samples`: Output averaging samples (default: 1)
- `derivative_averaging_samples`: Derivative averaging samples (default: 5)

**Features:**
- Climate entity (thermostat) for Home Assistant integration
- Live PID tuning via Home Assistant number entities
- Auto-tune button for automatic PID parameter calculation
- Deadband control to reduce oscillation near target
- Manual override fan control
- Individual PID control switches for each of 4 fans
- Real-time monitoring of P, I, D terms and error values

**Example:**
```yaml
packages:
  temperature_pid:
    url: https://github.com/zeroflow/esphome-fancontroller
    files: 
      - path: modules/temperature_pid.yaml
        vars:
          friendly_name: "Server Rack"
          kp: "0.39509"
          ki: "0.00470"
          kd: "20.74267"

```

**Tuning Tips:**
- Use the "PID Climate Autotune" button for automatic tuning
- Start with low kp/ki/kd values and increase gradually
- Monitor the P/I/D term sensors to understand controller behavior

### Choosing a Control Module

- **Linear Control**: Best for simple setups where you want predictable fan behavior based on temperature zones. Easy to understand and configure.
- **PID Control**: Best for precise temperature control and systems where you want to maintain a specific target temperature with minimal fluctuation.
- **RPM Status LEDs**: Can be combined with either control module to add visual feedback.

You can combine multiple modules in your configuration. For example, use PID control with RPM status LEDs for both precise control and visual feedback.

## Power Draw

The power usage of the device is dominated by the fans.
As a standalone device, these are the measured power figures in different operation modes.

Mode | Power Draw
---- | ----------
Active Wifi Transfer (e.g. OTA Upload) | 0.6W
Wifi connected, power save mode deactivated (not default) | 0.52W
```Default``` Wifi connected, LEDs showing status (one-colored) | 0.25W
Wifi connected, LEDs off | 0.2W
Deep Sleep | 0.07W

Disabling Wifi while not in deep sleep does not reduce power consumption, as the default light power save mode already does a good job.

These values have been measured via a DPS3005 power supply, therefore, their accuracy cannot be guaranteed.

## Ongoing Updates & Troubleshooting

**Over-the-Air Updates**: After initial setup, your board will appear in the ESPHome dashboard for wireless updates. No need to connect USB again.

**Troubleshooting Discovery Issues**: If your board doesn't appear in ESPHome after connecting to WiFi, check for mDNS issues on your network. You can work around this by manually specifying the board's IP address using the [manual_ip](https://esphome.io/components/wifi.html) configuration in your WiFi settings.

**Need Help?** Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/zeroflow/esphome-fancontroller/issues) or consult the ESPHome documentation.

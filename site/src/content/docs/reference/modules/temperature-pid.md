## Purpose

The Temperature PID module provides closed-loop PID thermostat control that automatically adjusts fan speed to maintain a target temperature. It creates a climate entity in Home Assistant that acts as a thermostat -- set your desired temperature and the controller handles the rest.

### How PID Works for Fan Control

PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative, three terms that work together:

- **Proportional (P):** Reacts to the current temperature error. The further the temperature is from the target, the faster the fans spin. This is the primary driver of fan speed.
- **Integral (I):** Corrects for persistent offset over time. If the P term alone can't quite reach the target, the I term slowly increases fan speed to close the gap.
- **Derivative (D):** Dampens rapid temperature changes. If temperature is rising quickly, the D term increases fan speed preemptively. Usually left at 0 for fan control since temperature changes are slow.

## When to Use

Choose PID when you need precise temperature maintenance with automatic adjustment -- for example, keeping a server closet at exactly 25 C. PID is the most capable temperature module but requires more configuration than the alternatives.

For simpler setups, consider [Temperature Linear](/reference/modules/temperature-linear/) (three-zone mapping) or [Temperature Curve](/reference/modules/temperature-curve/) (custom multi-point profile). See the [modules overview](/reference/modules/) for a comparison table.

## YAML Examples

### Basic Usage (Default Settings)

```yaml
packages:
  temperature_pid:
    url: https://github.com/zeroflow/wifi-fancontroller
    ref: main
    files:
      - path: modules/temperature_pid.yaml
        vars:
          friendly_name: "My Fan Controller"
```

### Custom Tuning Values

```yaml
packages:
  temperature_pid:
    url: https://github.com/zeroflow/wifi-fancontroller
    ref: main
    files:
      - path: modules/temperature_pid.yaml
        vars:
          friendly_name: "Server Rack"
          kp: "5.0"
          ki: "0.01"
          kd: "0.0"
```

## Scaling Convention (x100)

:::caution[UI Values Are Scaled]
The PID number entities in Home Assistant display values that are **100 times larger** than the internal PID values. This makes the numbers easier to read and adjust in the UI.

When you set `kp = 3.0` in the HA interface, the controller internally uses `0.03`.
:::

### Conversion Table

| Parameter | UI Value (HA) | Internal Value | UI Range |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| kp | 3.0 | 0.03 | 0 -- 50 |
| ki | 0.005 | 0.00005 | 0 -- 0.2 |
| kd | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0 -- 200 |

To convert: **Internal = UI / 100**

:::caution[PID Simulator Uses Internal Values]
The [PID simulator](/pid-simulator/) works with **internal (unscaled) values**. If the simulator suggests `kp = 0.05`, enter `5.0` in Home Assistant (multiply by 100). Always divide simulator values by 100 before comparing with HA UI values.
:::

## Tuning Tips

:::tip[Start with the Defaults]
The default values (`kp = 3.0`, `ki = 0.005`, `kd = 0.0`) work well for most setups. Try them before changing anything.
:::

**Getting started:**
- Set your target temperature in the thermostat entity and observe the behavior for 10-15 minutes
- Watch the **P term** sensor in HA -- it should react proportionally to temperature changes
- Watch the **I term** sensor -- it should slowly climb if the P term alone can't reach the target
- The **output value** sensor shows the combined fan speed percentage

**When to use Autotune:**
- Press the **PID Climate Autotune** button to let the controller calculate parameters automatically
- Autotune works best when the system is at a steady state (fans running, temperature stable)
- After autotune completes, the new parameters are saved to flash and persist across reboots

**Manual tuning:**
- Increase `kp` if fans react too slowly to temperature changes
- Increase `ki` if the temperature settles slightly above or below the target
- Leave `kd` at 0 unless you see oscillation -- temperature changes are usually slow enough that derivative control isn't needed

**Deadband:**
- The default deadband is +/- 0.25 C around the target temperature
- Inside the deadband, Ki is scaled to 4% of its normal value (`ki_multiplier = 0.04`), which prevents integral windup while allowing slow drift correction
- Increase the deadband thresholds if fans cycle on/off too frequently near the target

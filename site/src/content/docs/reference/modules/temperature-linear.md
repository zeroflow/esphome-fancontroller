description: Simple linear temperature-to-fan-speed mapping module

:::note[All Revisions]

## Purpose

The Temperature Linear module provides a simple three-zone mapping from temperature to fan speed. Define your temperature thresholds and fan speed percentages, and the controller handles the rest -- no complex tuning required.

## When to Use

Choose Linear when you want straightforward temperature-based fan control without the complexity of PID tuning or multi-point curves. It works well for most home and office setups where you just need fans to ramp up as temperature rises.

For more precise temperature targeting, consider [Temperature PID](/reference/modules/temperature-pid/). For finer control over the speed curve shape, see [Temperature Curve](/reference/modules/temperature-curve/). The [modules overview](/reference/modules/) has a comparison table.

:::tip[Works with Stall Guard]
This module cooperates with [Stall Guard](/reference/modules/stall-guard/) via a safety floor mechanism. If a fan stalls, Stall Guard sets a minimum speed that Temperature Linear will respect during recovery. No extra configuration needed — just include both modules.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `friendly_name` | `"Fancontroller"` | Device name prefix for all entities |
| `t_off` | `"25.0"` | Temperature below which fans turn off (C) |
| `t1` | `"30.0"` | Lower temperature setpoint (C) |
| `t2` | `"50.0"` | Upper temperature setpoint (C) |
| `fanpercent1` | `"30.0"` | Fan speed at t1 (%) |
| `fanpercent2` | `"100.0"` | Fan speed at t2 and above (%) |

## Zone Behavior

The module divides temperature into four zones:

| Zone | Temperature Range | Fan Speed | Behavior |
|------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| Off | Below `t_off` | 0% | Fans completely off |
| Constant low | `t_off` to `t1` | `fanpercent1` | Fans run at a fixed low speed |
| Ramp | `t1` to `t2` | `fanpercent1` to `fanpercent2` | Linear ramp between the two speeds |
| Constant high | Above `t2` | `fanpercent2` | Fans run at maximum configured speed |

With the defaults (t_off=25, t1=30, t2=50, fanpercent1=30%, fanpercent2=100%):
- Below 25 C: fans off
- 25-30 C: fans at 30%
- 30-50 C: fans ramp linearly from 30% to 100%
- Above 50 C: fans at 100%

## Home Assistant Entities

### Number Entities

| Entity | Range | Step | Unit | Default | Description |
|--------|-------|------|------|---------|-------------|
| Linear Off Temperature | 20 -- 50 | 0.5 | C | 25.0 | Temperature below which fans stop |
| Linear T1 | 20 -- 50 | 0.5 | C | 30.0 | Lower temperature setpoint |
| Linear T2 | 20 -- 50 | 0.5 | C | 50.0 | Upper temperature setpoint |
| Linear Fan Percent 1 | 0 -- 100 | 1 | % | 30 | Fan speed at T1 |
| Linear Fan Percent 2 | 0 -- 100 | 1 | % | 100 | Fan speed at T2 and above |

### Sensor Entities

| Entity | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Linear Output | % | Current calculated fan speed (updated every 10s) |

### Switch Entities

| Entity | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Auto Control Fan 1 | ON | Enable linear control for fan 1 |
| Auto Control Fan 2 | ON | Enable linear control for fan 2 |
| Auto Control Fan 3 | ON | Enable linear control for fan 3 |
| Auto Control Fan 4 | ON | Enable linear control for fan 4 |

## YAML Examples

### Basic Usage (Default Settings)

```yaml
packages:
  temperature_linear:
    url: https://github.com/zeroflow/wifi-fancontroller
    ref: main
    files:
      - path: modules/temperature_linear.yaml
        vars:
          friendly_name: "My Fan Controller"
```

### Quiet Desktop Profile

```yaml
packages:
  temperature_linear:
    url: https://github.com/zeroflow/wifi-fancontroller
    ref: main
    files:
      - path: modules/temperature_linear.yaml
        vars:
          friendly_name: "Desktop Cooler"
          t_off: "28.0"
          t1: "32.0"
          t2: "45.0"
          fanpercent1: "20.0"
          fanpercent2: "80.0"
```

This profile keeps fans off until 28 C, starts at a quiet 20%, and caps at 80% for reduced noise.

## Tuning Tips

:::tip[Start with the Defaults]
The defaults work for a wide range of setups. Adjust only after observing behavior for a few hours.
:::

- **Adjust `t_off` based on ambient temperature** -- if your room is normally 24 C, setting `t_off` to 25 C means fans only spin when something is actively generating heat
- **Set `fanpercent1` to your fans' minimum reliable speed** -- most fans need at least 20-30% PWM to start spinning consistently. Check the [troubleshooting guide](/getting-started/troubleshooting/) if fans stutter at low speeds.
- **Use the HA number entities to fine-tune** -- all five parameters can be adjusted live from Home Assistant without reflashing
- **Watch the Linear Output sensor** -- it shows the current calculated fan speed percentage, helpful for verifying your thresholds behave as expected

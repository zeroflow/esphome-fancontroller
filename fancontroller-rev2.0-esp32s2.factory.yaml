# It includes additional features for first-time setup:
# - Serial provisioning (ESP32-S2 does not support Bluetooth)
# - Dashboard import capabilities
#
# After adoption, the device will use the base configuration without these extras.

packages:
  # Include all of the core configuration
  core: !include fancontroller-rev2.0-esp32s2.yaml

esphome:
  # This will allow for project identification, configuration and updates
  project:
